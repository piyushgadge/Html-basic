"G" stands for "Generation". The main aim of wireless communications is that it provides high quality, reliable communication just like wired communication. As we know that while we have to connect to the internet, the speed of your internet depends upon the signal strength that has been in like 1G,2G,3G,4G,5G etc. Each and every generation is defined as a set of telephone network standards. Basically, evolution journey was started in the year 1979 from 1G technology and it is still continuing to 5G. 1G technology was not used to identify wireless technology until 2G, was released. That was a major jump in the technology when the wireless network went from analogue to digital. This post is very important for the evolution of differentiating 1G to 5G.
