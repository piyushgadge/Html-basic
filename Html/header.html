        An artist imagines Homo erectus pekinensis, by Cicero Moraes [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons. Editor’s note: 
        We are delighted to present a series by geologist Casey Luskin asking, “Do Fossils Demonstrate Human Evolution?” This is the fifth post in the series, 
        which is adapted from the recent book, The Comprehensive Guide to Science and Faith. 
        Find the full series here. After realizing that Homo habilis could not serve as a link between Homo and 
        Australopithecus, two paleoanthropologists lamented that “this muddle leaves Homo erectus without a clear 
        ancestor, without a past.”1 Indeed, it is difficult to find fossil hominins to serve as direct transitional 
        forms between the ape-like australopithecines and the first human-like members of Homo. 
        The fossil record shows abrupt changes that correspond to the appearance of our genus Homo about two million 
        years ago.

       From its first appearance, Homo erectus was very human-like, and differed markedly from prior
        hominins that were not human-like. Yet Homo erectus appears abruptly, without apparent evolutionary precursors. 
        An article in Natureexplains: The origins of the widespread, polymorphic, Early Pleistocene H. erectus lineage
         remain elusive. The marked contrasts between any potential ancestor (Homo habilis or other) and the earliest 
         known H. erectus might signal an abrupt evolutionary emergence some time before its first known appearance in 
         Africa at ~1.78 Myr [million years ago]. Uncertainties surrounding the taxon’s appearance in Eurasia and 
         southeast Asia make it impossible to establish accurately the time or place of origin for H. erectus.
         2 A 2016 paper likewise admits, “Although the transition from Australopithecus to Homo is usually thought 
         of as a momentous transformation, the fossil record bearing on the origin and earliest evolution of Homo is
          virtually undocumented.
       </p>

          ”3 While that paper argues that the evolutionary distance between Australopithecus and Homo is small, it
         concedes that the lineage that led to Homo is “unknown.”4 Unique and Previously Unseen Early members of
          Homo, namely Homo erectus, show unique and previously unseen features that contributed to this “abrupt” 
          appearance. The technical literature observes an “explosion,”5 “rapid increase,”6 and “approximate 
          doubling”7 in brain size associated with the appearance of Homo. Wood and Collard’s major Science 
          review found that only a single trait of one hominin species qualified as “intermediate” between
           Australopithecus and Homo: the brain size of Homo erectus.8 However, this one trait of brain size
            does not necessarily indicate that humans evolved from less intelligent hominids. Intelligence is 
            determined largely by internal brain organization, and is much more complex than the singular
             dimension of brain size.9 Christof Koch, president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, 
             observes that “total brain volume weakly correlates with intelligence … brain size accounts for
              between 9 and 16 percent of the overall variability in general intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
              ”10 Because of this, brain size is not always a good indicator of evolutionary relationships.11 In
         any case, erectus had an average brain size within the range of modern human variation. A few skulls 
         of “intermediate” size do not demonstrate that humans evolved from primitive ancestors. Much like the
          explosive increase in skull size, a study of the pelvis bones of australopithecines and Homo found 
          “a period of very rapid evolution corresponding to the emergence of the genus Homo.”12 One Nature
           paper noted that early Homo erectus shows “such a radical departure from previous forms of Homo 
           (such as H. habilis) in its height, reduced sexual dimorphism, long limbs, and modern body 
           proportions that it is hard at present to identify its immediate ancestry in east Africa.”13 
           A paper in the Journal of Molecular Biology and Evolution found that Homo and Australopithecus
            differ significantly in brain size, dental function, increased cranial buttressing, expanded
             body height, visual, and respiratory changes, and stated, We, like many others, interpret 
             the anatomical evidence to show that early H. sapiens was significantly and dramatically
              different from…australopithecines in virtually every element of its skeleton and every
               remnant of its behavior.14 “A Real Acceleration of Evolutionary Change” Noting these
                many differences, the study called the origin of humans “a real acceleration of 
                evolutionary change from the more slowly changing pace of australopithecine 
                evolution” and stated that such a transformation would have required radical changes: 
                The anatomy of the earliest H. sapiens sample indicates significant modifications of 
                the ancestral genome and is not simply an extension of evolutionary trends in an earlier 
                australopithecine lineage throughout the Pliocene. In fact, its combination of features 
                never appears earlier.

                15 These rapid and unique changes are termed “a genetic revolution” 
                in which “no australopithecine species is obviously transitional.”16 For those not constrained
                 by an evolutionary paradigm, it is not obvious that this transition took place at all. The
                  stark lack of fossil evidence for this hypothesized transition is confirmed by three Harvard 
                  paleoanthropologists: Of the various transitions that occurred during human evolution,
                   the transition from Australopithecus to Homo was undoubtedly one of the most critical 
                   in its magnitude and consequences. As with many key evolutionary events, there is both
                    good and bad news. First, the bad news is that many details of this transition are
                     obscure because of the paucity of the fossil and archaeological records.
